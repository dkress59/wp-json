# WordPress REST API typings

Automatically generated typings for WordPress's built-in RESTful API (/wp-json).

## ToDo

- [ ] Resolve `FIXME`s and `ToDo`s
- [X] Extraction of common types (e.g. WpPostStatus, WpPostType, â€¦)
- [ ] GitHub workflow for the publishing of a release
- [ ] Versioning by WP tag (e.g. v5.9.2.0 for WP v5.9.2)
- [ ] (Get rid of as many `any`s as possible)
- [ ] (move to @types/wp-json @DefinitelyTyped)
